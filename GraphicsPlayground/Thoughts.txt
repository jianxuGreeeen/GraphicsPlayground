This to to keep a record of thoughts as I add/make changes.
Primarily, how to properly structure/architect is constantly in my mind.
I have the two Graphics and GameGraphics to split game side and game agnostic work up.

Thoughts on Graphics:
Trying to strike a balance between over engineering and just making things work for now.
I would like the Graphics class to just take in data and operate on it.
No interaction back up to the GameGraphics layer.
I attempted to do a quick instancing/optimization by grouping draws by models.
Models share the same vertex and shader configuration.
A potential rework may be to group by shader configuration and build
I would also like to maintain just 1 vertex buffer and have models store offsets to their locations.

Thoughts
I think to encapsulate cameras, models, etc.
Maybe the concept of a scene class and we can have potentially multiple scenes.
